#Oxidation

A rusty (and automatic) implementation of the 'Owen' trading strategy. (not a
real strategy, just what I do... YMMV)

##Description

Oxidation is a concise and simple implementation of my personal trading
strategy, but in the hands of a bot. This project is mainly to display and test
my proficiency in the rust language, so hopefully it works out nicely :)

##Disclaimer
 
- Oxidation, and cryptocurrency in general do not carry any guarantee of profit or even breaking-even.
- Cryptocurrency is incredibly volatile, and large losses can result as a 
  result.
- Running a bot, or trading in general requires careful study of any risks
  involved. Not understanding these risks can lead to major losses.
- If you're serious about trading, and don't want to lose money *DO NOT USE
  THIS BOT* - only use this bot if you are interested in the aspect of
  automated trading, and/or developing your own bot.

##Documentation

###Dependencies

This is a rust project, and is being developed with the most recent stable
release of the rust toolchain. Do not use nightly as it can yield unpredictable
results.

We recommend using `rustup` as it greatly simplifies the toolchain setup
process.

###Running

Cargo is configured to run the app, so `cargo run` should be sufficient.

**Further info will be added here later on, detailing configuration.**
